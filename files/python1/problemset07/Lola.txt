Lola by Shel Silverstein

Lola loves me,
Lola cares,
Lola picks me peaches and pears.
Lola offers me candy and Cokes,
Lola listens and laughs at me jokes.
Lola helps when I get in a fight,
Lola does all my homework at night.
Lola misses me,
Lola cries,
Lola thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Lola is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Lola just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Lola's hand,
In the darkness where Lola usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Lola's gone!
